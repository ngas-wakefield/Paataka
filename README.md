# $how Me The Money

## Week 7 - Large group project

Meetings are expensive, but sometimes we forget how expensive they are and feel the need to talk for too long about topics that are unimportant for the meeting purpose.

This is an app to display the costs of meetings, and track the costs of your meetings over time.

The idea of the App is to be able to display the real-time cost of a meeting as it occurs.
This cost is calculated based on the hourly wages of the meeting's attendees and the current duration of the meeting.

The intended effect of this App is to make meeting attendees aware of how much this time is costing the business.

## The Tech

A boilerplate is already set up for you (Thanks Harrison!) with everything you will need to get started. This boilerplate is set up to use:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html)
* [Knex.js (SQL)](https://knexjs.org/)
* [Bulma (CSS framework)](https://bulma.io/documentation/)
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* [Authenticare (local auth)](https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/authenticare/tree/main/docs)

The migration and seeds for the users table, and all login functionality is already set up!

The mobile responsiveness is also being handled by some neat JS and Bulma classes, be sure to incorporate that view in your project goals!

SCSS files are included in `client/styles`. Make sure you define your own CSS in these files too, as the files in the public folder (`styles.css` & `styles.css.map`) are generated from these `.scss` files (just like the `bundle.js` & `bundle.js.map` are generated from your component files) and will be overwritten. 

## User Stories

### MVP

As a user:
  * I want to register for the App under my name, and state my hourly wage
  * I want to start a new meeting, and add all the meeting members. (MVP: Add member names and wages manually)
  * I want to start my created meeting, and see a ($) cost tracker display the current meeting cost every second
  * I want to be able to save a meeting's cost, attendees, duration and date/time when it is finished for later viewing
  * I want to be able to view previous meetings in date/time order, and see more information about a past meeting.
  * I want to see a graph of meeting costs over time

### Stretch
  * I want to be able to select existing users of the App as meeting attendees, so that our wages don't have to be shown / inputted manually. If a meeting attendee doesn't have an account, I want to be able to manually add them to the App.
  * I want to set a Maximum Cost an Maximum Duration for my Meeting, and see colourised progress bar displaying both of these
  * I want to be able to state my yearly salary rather than hourly rate as an option on register
  * I want to be able to view all meetings that I am an attendee for, and I want information about my meetings to not be visible to all users of the app.
  * I want to create a group of regular attendees for my meeting group to make setting up my meeting easier.
  * I want to be able to write notes or summaries for meetings upon saving them.

## Setup

### JWT_secret
1. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and call it `.env`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Change the JWT_secret variable in the file (this will be the secret on your computer, so no need to match it to your team mates). This will be used to hash some user information and keep it safe from prying eyes.

You may also notice git does not track this `.env` as it is named in the `.gitignore`.

### Run your app
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run
```

To run in development:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To run in production:
```sh
npm start
```


## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

To push your local master branch to your heroku app:
```sh
npm run h:deploy
```

Run heroku migrations:
```sh
npm run h:migrate
```

Run heroku seeds:
```sh
npm run h:seed
```

If ever you need to rollback, you can also:
```sh
npm run h:rollback
```


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
